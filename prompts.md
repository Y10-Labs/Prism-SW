## üìã **Usage Instructions for Cursor AI**

### **How to Use These Prompts:**

1. **Start with Setup Prompts (1-2)** - Get basic project structure
2. **Core Systems (3-6)** - Build fundamental game classes
3. **World Management (7-8)** - Level and scene systems
4. **Input & Integration (9-10)** - User interaction and world coordination
5. **Audio & Events (11-12)** - Sound and trigger systems
6. **Integration (13-14)** - Complete game loop and testing
7. **Debug & Optimization (15-16)** - Development tools and performance

### **For Each Prompt:**
- Copy the prompt exactly to Cursor AI
- Wait for complete implementation
- Test the generated code
- Ask for fixes if needed: "Fix compilation errors in the generated code"
- Move to next prompt only after current one works

### **Additional Helper Prompts:**

```
"Fix all compilation errors in the current code and ensure it compiles with g++ -std=c++17"

"Add error handling and null pointer checks to the generated code"

"Optimize this code for embedded systems with limited memory"

"Add comprehensive comments and documentation to the generated code"

"Create a simple test function to verify this system works correctly"
```

This systematic approach will give you a complete, working horror game codebase that integrates with your existing OpenGL rendering system!
